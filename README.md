## Installing
Download the zip and extract to a web folder on apache, or clone the repo.

## Building (not needed to use)
If updaing a JS lib or altering the _index template, you need to rebuild the application.

Once downloaded, run `npm install` to setup depends, and `npm run build` to re-generate SHA hash on _index/index.php.


## Contrinuting
Whether you're a designer, developer, technical writer, or cryptologist, you can likely make nadachat better for all. If you see something, say something; open an issue or whip up a pull request. Safety is the top priority above all else; don't contribute something that reduces safety. But if you can make it prettier, faster, smoother, more secure, or make these documentation pages more cogent, please don't be shy. This is a project the whole world should have a stake in.
